🎼 AI Music Generation with LSTM
This project is an AI-powered music generator that uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers to learn musical patterns from MIDI files and generate new original music compositions.

📁 Project Structure
AI_model.h5 – Trained Keras model (saved automatically after training).

AI_generated.mid – Output MIDI file generated by the model.

mid_songs/ – Folder containing the MIDI training files.

music_generation.py – Main Python script (the code you've written).

🧠 How It Works
Data Preparation:

Loads MIDI files from the mid_songs/ directory.

Parses musical notes and chords using music21.

Converts the notes/chords into sequences suitable for neural network training.

Model Training:

Builds an LSTM-based neural network if no pre-trained model exists.

Trains the model on the parsed note sequences.

Saves the trained model as AI_model.h5.

Music Generation:

Uses the trained model to predict a sequence of notes.

Converts the predicted sequence back into musical notation.

Exports the generated music as a new MIDI file AI_generated.mid.

📦 Requirements
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy keras music21
Make sure you have:

A folder named mid_songs in your working directory

Several .mid files inside it (at least 20 valid note sequences recommended)

▶️ How to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
python music_generation.py
If AI_model.h5 exists, it will load the model and skip training.

If not, it will train the model using available MIDI files.

🎵 Output
After running, the script will generate a new song and save it as:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
AI_generated.mid
You can play this file using any MIDI player (e.g., VLC, Windows Media Player, GarageBand).

📌 Notes
The model learns from patterns, so more diverse and quality MIDI files will improve output quality.

If there are fewer than 20 valid notes, training will not proceed.

You can experiment with longer sequences, different model architectures, or genre-specific MIDI datasets for unique results.
